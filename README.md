# A Guide for Future Learners on Creative Computing:
<kbd> Words in bold have definitions at the bottom of the page
### Your week ahead: 

This week, you will learn about physical computing, more specifically, circuit design - understanding how to light up an LED using an **Arduino Box**. Through a Read Me file on the **GitHub** platform, you will need to code your response to the brief. This could be anything from a learning log on your circuit design experience to explaining your thoughts on physical computing. For Friday, you will simply need to submit the link to your **Read Me File** onto Padlet.

### My experience:

**Creative Computing** is an area I was not familiar with and not very interested in before starting this project. During the long (and boring) presentation, I still wasn’t clear about the brief but had learned some key information on GitHub and saw examples of existing works, particularly the community rules of p5.js which inspired me to focus on helping people.  

We then moved on to practical **Physical Computing** where we were given an Arduino kit to light up an LED. I had a YouTube tutorial and followed all steps but my LED still wouldn’t turn on. I then moved on to **TinkerCad**, where there, I was able to make it work. So, do not worry, sometimes you may be stuck and not understand why but it’s part of this challenging project. As to what to write for your read me file, make sure you are interested in what you are writing, otherwise, you will likely procrastinate and complete it the day before. 

### My tips:
- Do not give up even if it doesn’t work - reflects coding (as the tutor said) - and focus if you’re not interested
- Overcome fear about digital things
- Start by doing physical computing and then can move onto autocad if it’s easier  
- Comforting music to stimulate your mind 

### How to ‘RGB LED Color Mixing’: 

### What you will need: 

Jumper Wires (2 Black, 3 Red, 1 Yellow, 1 Green), LED’s (1 Red, 1 Yellow, 1 Green), Arduino Uno R3, Breadboard Small, 3 resistors, Cable plugged

### If you are using AutoCad, here is the link:

https://www.tinkercad.com/dashboard?type=circuits&collection=designs

### Follow these steps: 

### LED’s (Breadboard Small): 

- Red - 9D to 10D
- Yellow - 12D to 13D
- Green - 15D to 16D

### Resistors (Breadboard Small):

- Negative (-) to 9B (Red)
- Negative (-) to 12B (Yellow)
- Negative (-) to 15B (Green)

### Short Jumper Wire (Arduino Uno R3 to Breadboard Small): 

- 13 to 10B (Red)
- 12 to 13A (Yellow)
- 11 to 16A (Green) 

### Long Jumper Wire (Breadboard Small):

- 5V to + (near 30) (red)
- GND to - (near 30) (black)
- (+) to +  (from left to right side) (red)
- (-) to - (from left to right side) (black)

Connect the cable from the Arduino Uno R3 to your laptop so that it has the power to light up the LED. Then, simply turn on the switch button, and it should light it up!

### Terms: 

**Arduino Box:** Kit containing everything required to light up led’s. This includes jumper wires, resistors, LED’s, a pushbutton, a breadboard small, an Arduino Uno R3 and a cable to connect with a laptop for power.
 
**Github:** Platform for Software Developers to code. It is an open-source community (GitHub: Where the world builds software, 2021). 

**Read Me File:** Text & Images explaining software, updates, codes etc… For instance, patches for a video game (README - Wikipedia, 2018).

**Tinker Cad:** Digital 3D program. In this case, online physical computing.

**Physical Computing:** Programming real-life objects from a laptop (Physical computing: teaching the teachers, 2021). 

**Creative Computing:** Combining art and computing (BSc (Hons) Creative Computing, 2021).
